    The epoch is the point where the time starts, and is platform dependent. For Unix, the epoch is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC).
To find out what the epoch is on a given platform, look at time.gmtime(0).

    The term seconds since the epoch refers to the total number of elapsed seconds since the epoch, typically excluding leap seconds.
Leap seconds are excluded from this total on all POSIX-compliant platforms.

    The functions in this module may not handle dates and times before the epoch or far in the future. The cut-off point in the future
is determined by the C library; for 32-bit systems, it is typically in 2038.
