Procedural Programming
Procedural came first and the focus is on actions
commands operate on data but there is no direct relationship

object oriented approach instead has a focus on things
a thing has a certain atrributes and tere are certain acctions tyou can do to that tging

onject oriented OO
a window in a graphica user interface is an excellent application of OO
a window has a width and height attributes
a window can be minimized and resized


procedural example
suppose you wanted to build and application to do what if anlaysis on operationnal cost of a vehicle
you need to know the MPG
create a loop
prompt the user for each value do math and displayu it
w here as you could create a class and define methods and attributes but its probableasier to go step by step

which is better

programmers tend to gravitate to one or the other

OO is a better fit in terms of design time and mainteance for apps but not all

choose based on your approach
